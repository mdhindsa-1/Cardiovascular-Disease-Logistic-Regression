# Cardiovascular-Disease-Logistic-Regression

*This was a group project*

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States with approximately
655,000 deaths every year. With cardiovascular disease being so prevalent in our country, our
group was interested in better understanding the factors that may lead to someone developing
cardiovascular disease in their lifetime. In order to do so, we utilized the Kaggle Cardiovascular
Disease dataset that contains various medical information and factors for 70,000 patients. This
data was collected for each person during a medical examination visit with various features
related to heart disease that span objective, examination, and subjective inputs. Objective inputs
are factual information, examination inputs are results determined from the examination of the
person, and lastly, subjective inputs are information provided by the person about themselves.
Our goal is to build a logistic regression model to understand which factors have a greater
influence on the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.
